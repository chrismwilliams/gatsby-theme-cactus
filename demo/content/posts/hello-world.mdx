Hello world!!! This is an example blog post showcasing some of the cool stuff this theme can do. Following is an example blog post written in an mdx file. You can find me @ `demo/content/posts/my-first-post.mdx`. Here you can add/update/delete details and watch the changes live when running in develop mode.

## Using MDX to create blog pages

You can find out more about mdx and how to use it with Gatsby on <Underline themeColor="text" hoverThemeColor="secondary">[mdxjs](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started "MDX JS getting started")</Underline>'s website, and here with <Underline themeColor="text" hoverThemeColor="secondary">[Gatsby docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/mdx/ "Gatsby docs on mdx")</Underline>.

## Using some markdown elements

Here we have a simple js code block.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

This is styled by <Underline themeColor="text" hoverThemeColor="secondary">[Prism](https://prismjs.com/ "Prism website")</Underline> via a package from <Underline themeColor="text" hoverThemeColor="secondary">[Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/packages/prism "Theme UI prism package")</Underline>.

You can choose your own preset from this package, currently it's set to Dracula, in the shadowed file `demo/src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js`.

## Importing images with mdx

Gatsby Theme Cactus uses another theme called Gatsby Theme Blog Core to read MDX files, and embedded images.
